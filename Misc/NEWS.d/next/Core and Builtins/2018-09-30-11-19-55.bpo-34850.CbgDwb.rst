The compiler now produces a :exc:`SyntaxWarning` when identity checks
(``is`` and ``is not``) are used with certain types of literals
(e.g. strings, ints).  These can often work by accident in CPython,
but are not guaranteed by the language spec.  The warning advises users
to use equality tests (``==`` and ``!=``) instead.
